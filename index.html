              Theirs is a story of fate, friendship and an abundance of love. As
              a financial consultant, Koko travels for work on a consistent
              basis and in 2022, while on a travel engagement in Raleigh, North
              Carolina, a mutual friend of theirs (Nkem) invited them
              (seperately) for her birthday in Miami, Florida. Koko's normal
              weekly travel schedule did not permit this trip, but she accepted
              the invite and updated her travel plans to be at Nkem's birthday
              celebration. Koko made travel arrangements to arrive on Saturday
              evening (April 23rd). As fate would have it, she missed her
              original flight and was immediately rebooked for the next flight
              leaving that evening. Upon arriving, Nkem introduced the birthday
              crew and Koko's eyes caught a familiar face. Prior to this, Nkem
              has mentioned that two guys would be on this trip (including
              Inyene). As a side note, Koko and Inyene (fondly known as Helen
              and Kingsley) first crossed paths in 2019 when Nkem introduced him
              as the Software/IT person to build their business website. After
              their first introduction in 2019, Inyene invited Koko to his
              Friendsgiving in the same year and she invited him to her birthday
              in 2020 (amidst the COVID-19 pandemic). They remained
              acquaintances until that fateful rendezvous in Miami on April 23,
              2022.

              Unknown to her, Inyene had been asking Nkem about Koko since their
              first meeting in 2019 but he was unavailable to make his
              intentions known. However, once in Miami, let’s just say Inyene
              could not wait to loud those intentions to whoever cared to
              listen. The guys arrived on Friday and explored Miami (South
              Beach) but Inyene refused to entertain anyone until she arrived.
              We later learned that Inyene confirmed his travel immediately
              after he learned that "Helen may be coming". Later that night in a
              Miami bar with the rest of the birthday crew, Inyene asked Koko
              for her drink of choice. And as he proceeded to give her the
              drink, he expressed not only how much he was interested in her,
              but also how long he’s been interested. She shrugged off his
              admiration to the familiarity often associated with cocktails and
              music but his admiration became clearer when one of Nkem’s friends
              told Inyene that she had someone for him and he boldly replied
              saying, “Don’t worry about that, the person I like is sitting
              right next to you.” We later learned that prior to this trip,
              Inyene mentioned to his parents that in addition to celebrating
              Nkem, there was someone (who may be on this trip) that he liked
              and was looking forward to meeting. And his mum responded,
              beckoning on him to "go have fun" and "to keep an open mind".
              Little did they know that Saturday night in Miami was the
              beginning of something unexpected and beautiful.
            </p>
            <p class="article--body">
              Sunday was Jet Ski and Beach Day, and they both had an amazing
              time. Inyene and Koko talked more and realized how much they had
              in common. They learned that his brother attended Loyola Jesuit
              College like she did, and they also learned that they had
              unknowingly been messaging each other on IG for months prior.
              Miami revealed that Inyene knew considerably more about Koko than
              she imagined.
            </p>
            <p class="article--body">
              Birthday festivities ended for Koko and Inyene on Sunday night
              since they had early morning flights on Monday. They rode in the
              same Uber to the airport and talked some more. Inyene flew back to
              Washington DC, and Koko flew to Raleigh, North Carolina. They
              talked every day and each time, Inyene reminded Koko of his
              intentions, even though she refused to take him seriously. Two
              weeks later, Koko told Inyene that she did not see anything beyond
              friendship between them. And to her surprise, Inyene made it
              evident that he was ready to be in her life in any capacity that
              she was comfortable with, even if it was just friendship. Their
              friendship blossomed and shortly afterwards, Inyene invited Koko
              to a weekend in DC and she obliged him.
            </p>
            <p class="article--body">
              Koko's birthday was on the horizon, and she decided to travel to
              West Palm Beach, Florida. Without giving it much thought, she
              invited Inyene, and he was all in. Inyene and Koko bonded on the
              flight to West Palm. They talked about their families, their
              upbringings, tales of moving to the US and navigating their lives
              here, their shared values, their interests and more. They
              celebrated Koko's birthday together and returned to DC. At this
              time, Koko was on another travel engagement in Indiana/Chicago. On
              travel engagements, she could either travel home or travel someone
              to her location, so she invited Inyene and that was the weekend
              when they went on their first date. Koko teased Inyene that he had
              to take her on 5 amazing dates before she gave him an answer.
              Inyene planned their first date, and she was simply blown away by
              his attention, his intention, and his empathy. Their first date
              went beautifully, and it was then that she knew.
            </p>
            <p class="article--body">
              They were officially dating and Inyene had already started
              planning their second date. During the July 4th holiday, as they
              were driving to the grocery store, Inyene received a call from his
              mum. He had promised to help marinate the meats so he asked Koko
              if she was comfortable riding along with him to his parents so he
              could complete the task and return home afterwards. With an open
              mind, Koko obliged Inyene and his parents welcomed her with open
              arms. She later learned that this visit established her permanent
              presence in Inyene's life long before even agreeing to be
              together.
            </p>
            <p class="article--body">
              Inyene planned their second date for July 15th in DC. This date is
              incredibly memorable to Koko for so many reasons. It is her dad’s
              birthday, and that day was the second birthday that was spent
              without him. That morning, Koko went to run errands while keeping
              the special evening in mind, only to return home to the most
              beautiful bouquet of sunflowers. The card on the flowers read:
              “Next To You Is Exactly Where I Want To Be, Every Single Day, Mon
              Coeur! Kingsley.” Words could not describe her emotions that day,
              but it felt like God was steering the wheel. Throughout the date,
              Koko kept Inyene on edge by saying that her answer was largely
              dependent on the date's outcome even though she already knew. They
              walked back to the car, reeling from this spectacular date and
              right in front of the car, Inyene asked her again and she said
              “Yes, I’d love to be your girlfriend”. It is safe to say that Koko
              knew her answer from date #1 and that she did not need 5 dates to
              decide or confirm how she felt towards Inyene.
            </p>
            <p class="article--body">
              Inyene lived in Washington DC while Koko lived 50mins west of DC
              which implied commuting to visit each other. During this time,
              they had nursed the idea of living together and Koko shared that
              she had always wanted to live in DC for a year. With Inyene’s
              lease approaching expiration, it was perfect timing to research
              and tour apartments in DC. Inyene took Koko to all the apartment
              tours which left them torn between 2 apartment options. On one of
              our last tours, Inyene blurted out that he was interested in
              moving to Ashburn. This impulsive idea turned out to be a blessing
              in disguise for Koko and Inyene.
            </p>
            <p class="article--body">
              Koko's mum visits the US every year from Nigeria and splits her
              time between Los Angeles and Virginia. When she visited Koko in
              September, Inyene also visited and they connected right away. Koko
              shared that they were planning to move in together and as Mother's
              do, she asked about their intentions, advised Koko, and asked that
              she prayed about it. Inyene started moving out towards the end of
              October, and on November 1st, they began living together. They
              spent thanksgiving celebrating Inyene’s mum’s 60th birthday, where
              their relationship was further solidified by all the introductions
              to friends and family in attendance.
            </p>
            <p class="article--body">
              Koko was unable to travel to Nigeria in December 2022, so they
              planned to spend the Christmas holiday in Puerto Rico. Basking in
              the warmth and tranquility of Puerto Rico, they did not want the
              vacation to end. They welcomed 2023 with gratitude, commitment,
              and renewed love for each other. On New Year's Day, they
              celebrated together with Inyene's family. Inyene later shared that
              his parents were asking when he would propose to Koko and curious
              of his response, Inyene responded saying it will happen soon,
              "within the year".
            </p>
            <p class="article--body">
              Each time the proposal topic arose, Inyene said he would only
              share that it would happen before my birthday in June 2023. In
              January, Koko had begun consulting locally and the hours got
              intense very quickly. No matter how late she worked, Inyene still
              drove to pick her up from the train station, night after night. As
              a treat to compensate for the long working hours, Koko reserved
              tickets for them to experience (for the first time) a Shen Yun
              Performance at the Kennedy Center in Washington, DC. The
              performance was simply breathtaking and was experienced with the
              best company.

        <p class="article--title">The Proposal</p>
        <p class="article--body">
          Fast forward to April 2023, shy of a month from Koko's birthday,
          coupled with crazy work hours, Inyene thought they were overdue for
          another date. Koko was so excited for it that she looked up the venue,
          their menu and selected exactly want she wanted to eat. Inyene
          mentioned that they should dress nicely since he planned to take
          pictures. Koko simply wanted to enjoy the date and the food so
          whatever Inyene suggested was totally fine. He already made all the
          reservations for April 30th. The day began and they completed chores
          and got ready for their brunch date. As time for brunch drew nearer,
          Koko told Inyene that there was no time to get her nails done and he
          responded saying that he had called and shifted the time, meaning she
          had time to finish her nails (this should have been a give-away, but
          she was oblivious). Inyene insisted on helping with her nails and once
          they finished, Inyene drove to the brunch location. Upon arriving,
          Koko asked Inyene to drop her in front of the restaurant so that they
          do not miss their reservation. He calmly insisted that they both walk
          in together. It was a slightly chilly day with some rain, but nothing
          was coming between Koko and her brunch, so they walked in together
          with Koko walking a little bit ahead, protecting her face from the
          precipitation. As she entered the restaurant, walking past the
          reception, her jaw dropped in excitement and pleasant surprise. Koko's
          eyes beheld each of her closest female friends and some of his as
          well. It was at that point that she realized what was happening. In
          amazement and utter disbelief, she turned around to question Inyene,
          only to find him on one knee asking her to be his wife. All the
          emotions laid bare and right in that moment, she said the easiest “YES
          To Forever” to her best friend, just 9 months after saying "YES" to
          becoming his girlfriend.

            Calabar is a 1hr flight from Lagos or Abuja and a 4hr drive from
            Port Harcourt, all of which are international airports. There are
            also several transportation services into Calabar from all parts of
            Nigeria. On the day of the event, a shuttle will provide
            transportation from the hotel to the wedding venue. The shuttle will
            depart 15 mins before the event and return half hour after 6PM.
