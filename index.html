        <p class="article--body">
          Theirs is a story of fate, friendship and an abundance of love. As a
          financial consultant, Koko travels for work on a consistent basis and
          in 2022, while on a travel engagement in Raleigh, North Carolina, a
          mutual friend of theirs (Nkem) invited them (seperately) for her
          birthday in Miami, Florida. Koko's normal weekly travel schedule did
          not permit this trip, but she accepted the invite and updated her
          travel plans to be at Nkem's birthday celebration. Koko made travel
          arrangements to arrive on Saturday evening (April 23rd). As fate would
          have it, she missed her original flight and was immediately rebooked
          for the next flight leaving that evening. Upon arriving, Nkem
          introduced the birthday crew and Koko's eyes caught a familiar face.
          Prior to this, Nkem has mentioned that two guys would be on this trip
          (including Inyene). As a side note, Koko and Inyene (fondly known as
          Helen and Kingsley) first crossed paths in 2019 when Nkem introduced
          him as the Software/IT person to build our business website. After
          their first introduction in 2019, Inyene invited Koko to his
          Friendsgiving in the same year and she invited him to her birthday in
          2020 (amidst the COVID-19 pandemic). They remained acquaintances until
          that fateful rendezvous in Miami on April 23, 2022.
        </p>
        <p class="article--body">
          Unknown to her, Inyene had been asking Nkem about Koko since their
          first meeting in 2019 but he was unavailable to make his intentions
          known. However, once in Miami, let’s just say Inyene could not wait to
          loud those intentions to whoever cared to listen. The guys arrived on
          Friday and explored Miami (South Beach) but Inyene refused to
          entertain anyone until she arrived. We later learned that Inyene
          confirmed his travel immediately after he learned that "Helen may be
          coming". Later that night in a Miami bar with the rest of the birthday
          crew, Inyene asked Koko for her drink of choice. And as he proceeded
          to give her the drink, he expressed not only how much he was
          interested in her, but also how long he’s been interested. She
          shrugged off his admiration to the familiarity often associated with
          cocktails and music but his admiration became clearer when one of
          Nkem’s friends told Inyene that she had someone for him and he boldly
          replied saying, “Don’t worry about that, the person I like is sitting
          right next to you.” We later learned that prior to this trip, Inyene
          mentioned to his parents that in addition to celebrating Nkem, there
          was someone (who may be on this trip) that he liked and was looking
          forward to meeting. And his mum responded, beckoning on him to "go
          have fun" and "to keep an open mind". Little did they know that
          Saturday night in Miami was the beginning of something unexpected and
          beautiful.
        </p>
        <p class="article--body">
          Sunday was Jet Ski and Beach Day, and we both had an amazing time.
          Inyene and Koko talked more and realized how much they had in common.
          They learned that his brother attended Loyola Jesuit College like she
          did, and they also learned that they had unknowingly been messaging
          each other on IG for months prior. Miami revealed that Inyene knew
          considerably more about Koko than she imagined.
        </p>
        <p class="article--body">
          Birthday festivities ended for Koko and Inyene on Sunday night since
          they had early morning flights on Monday. They rode in the same Uber
          to the airport and talked some more. Inyene flew back to Washington
          DC, and Koko flew to Raleigh, North Carolina. They talked every day
          and each time, Inyene reminded Koko of his intentions, even though she
          refused to take him seriously. Two weeks later, Koko told Inyene that
          she did not see anything beyond friendship between them. And to her
          surprise, Inyene made it evident that he was ready to be in her life
          in any capacity that she was comfortable with, even if it was just
          friendship. Their friendship blossomed and shortly afterwards, Inyene
          invited Koko to a weekend in DC and she obliged him.
        </p>
        <p class="article--body">
          Koko's birthday was on the horizon, and she decided to travel to West
          Palm Beach, Florida. Without giving it much thought, she invited
          Inyene, and he was all in. Inyene and Koko bonded on the flight to
          West Palm. They talked about their families, their upbringings, tales
          of moving to the US and navigating their lives here, their shared
          values, their interests and more. They celebrated Koko's birthday
          together and returned to DC. At this time, Koko was on another travel
          engagement in Indiana/Chicago. On travel engagements, she could either
          travel home or travel someone to her location, so she invited Inyene
          and that was the weekend when they went on their first date. Koko
          teased Inyene that he had to take her on 5 amazing dates before she
          gave him an answer. Inyene planned their first date, and she was
          simply blown away by his attention, his intention, and his empathy.
          Their first date went beautifully, and it was then that she knew.
        </p>
        <p class="article--body">
          They were officially dating and Inyene had already started planning
          their second date. During the July 4th holiday, as they were driving
          to the grocery store, Inyene received a call from his mum. He had
          promised to help marinate the meats so he asked Koko if she was
          comfortable riding along with him to his parents so he could complete
          the task and return home afterwards. With an open mind, Koko obliged
          Inyene and his parents welcomed her with open arms. She later learned
          that this visit established her permanent presence in Inyene's life
          long before even agreeing to be together.
        </p>
        <p class="article--body">
          Inyene planned their second date for July 15th in DC. This date is
          incredibly memorable to Koko for so many reasons. It is her dad’s
          birthday, and that day was the second birthday that was spent without
          him. That morning, Koko went to run errands while keeping the special
          evening in mind, only to return home to the most beautiful bouquet of
          sunflowers. The card on the flowers read: “Next To You Is Exactly
          Where I Want To Be, Every Single Day, Mon Coeur! Kingsley.” Words
          could not describe her emotions that day, but it felt like God was
          steering the wheel. Throughout the date, Koko kept Inyene on edge by
          saying that her answer was largely dependent on the date's outcome
          even though she already knew. They walked back to the car, reeling
          from this spectacular date and right in front of the car, Inyene asked
          her again and she said “Yes, I’d love to be your girlfriend”. It is
          safe to say that Koko knew her answer from date #1 and that she did
          not need 5 dates to decide or confirm how she felt towards Inyene.
        </p>
        <p class="article--body">
          Inyene lived in Washington DC while Koko lived 50mins west of DC which
          implied commuting to visit each other. During this time, they had
          nursed the idea of living together and Koko shared that she had always
          wanted to live in DC for a year. With Inyene’s lease approaching
          expiration, it was perfect timing to research and tour apartments in
          DC. Inyene took Koko to all the apartment tours which left them torn
          between 2 apartment options. On one of our last tours, Inyene blurted
          out that he was interested in moving to Ashburn. This impulsive idea
          turned out to be a blessing in disguise for Koko and Inyene.
        </p>
        <p class="article--body">
          Koko's mum visits the US every year from Nigeria and splits her time
          between Los Angeles and Virginia. When she visited Koko in September,
          Inyene also visited and they connected right away. Koko shared that
          they were planning to move in together and as Mother's do, she asked
          about their intentions, advised Koko, and asked that she prayed about
          it. Inyene started moving out towards the end of October, and on
          November 1st, they began living together. They spent thanksgiving
          celebrating Inyene’s mum’s 60th birthday, where their relationship was
          further solidified by all the introductions to friends and family in
          attendance.
        </p>
        <p class="article--body">
          Koko was unable to travel to Nigeria in December 2022, so they planned
          to spend the Christmas holiday in Puerto Rico. Basking in the warmth
          and tranquility of Puerto Rico, they did not want the vacation to end.
          They welcomed 2023 with gratitude, commitment, and renewed love for
          each other. On New Year's Day, they celebrated together with Inyene's
          family. Inyene later shared that his parents were asking when he would
          propose to Koko and curious of his response, Inyene responded saying
          it will happen soon, "within the year".
        </p>
        <p class="article--body">
          Each time the proposal topic arose, Inyene said he would only share
          that it would happen before my birthday in June 2023. In January, Koko
          had begun consulting locally and the hours got intense very quickly.
          No matter how late she worked, Inyene still drove to pick her up from
          the train station, night after night. As a treat to compensate for the
          long working hours, Koko reserved tickets for them to experience (for
          the first time) a Shen Yun Performance at the Kennedy Center in
          Washington, DC. The performance was simply breathtaking and was
          experienced with the best company.
        </p>
        <hr />
        <p class="article--title">The Proposal</p>
        <p class="article--body">
          Fast forward to April 2023, shy of a month from Koko's birthday,
          coupled with crazy work hours, Inyene thought they were overdue for
          another date. Koko was so excited for it that she looked up the venue,
          their menu and selected exactly want she wanted to eat. Inyene
          mentioned that they should dress nicely since he planned to take
          pictures. Koko simply wanted to enjoy the date and the food so
          whatever Inyene suggested was totally fine. He already made all the
          reservations for April 30th. The day began and they completed chores
          and got ready for their brunch date. As time for brunch drew nearer,
          Koko told Inyene that there was no time to get her nails done and he
          responded saying that he had called and shifted the time, meaning she
          had time to finish her nails (this should have been a give-away, but
          she was oblivious). Inyene insisted on helping with her nails and once
          they finished, Inyene drove to the brunch location. Upon arriving,
          Koko asked Inyene to drop her in front of the restaurant so that they
          do not miss their reservation. He calmly insisted that they both walk
          in together. It was a slightly chilly day with some rain, but nothing
          was coming between Koko and her brunch, so they walked in together
          with Koko walking a little bit ahead, protecting her face from the
          precipitation. As she entered the restaurant, walking past the
          reception, her jaw dropped in excitement and pleasant surprise. Koko's
          eyes beheld each of her closest female friends and some of his as
          well. It was at that point that she realized what was happening. In
          amazement and utter disbelief, she turned around to question Inyene,
          only to find him on one knee asking her to be his wife. All the
          emotions laid bare and right in that moment, she said the easiest “YES
          To Forever” to her best friend, just 9 months after saying "YES" to
          becoming his girlfriend.
