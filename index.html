        <p class="article--body">
          Ours is a story of fate, friendship and an abundance of love. As a
          financial consultant, Koko travels for work on a consistent basis and
          in 2022, while on a travel engagement in Raleigh NC, a mutual friend
          of theirs (Nkem) invited us (seperately) for her birthday in Miami,
          FL. Koko's weekly travel schedule did not permit this trip, but she
          accepted the invite and updated her travel plans to be at Nkem's
          birthday celebration. Koko made travel plans to arrive on Saturday
          evening (April 23rd). As fate would have it, Koko missed her original
          flight and was immediately rebooked for the next flight leaving that
          evening. Upon arriving, Nkem introduced the birthday crew and Koko's
          eyes caught a familiar face. Prior to this, Nkem has mentioned that
          two guys would be on this trip (Inyene included). Koko and Inyene
          first crossed paths in 2019 when Nkem introduced him as a Software/IT
          person to build our business website. After their first introduction
          in 2019, Inyene invited Koko to his Friendsgiving in the same year and
          she invited him to her birthday in 2020 (amidst the COVID-19
          pandemic). They remained acquaintances until that fateful meeting in
          Miami on April 23, 2022.
        </p>
        <p class="article--body">
          Unknown to her, Inyene had been asking Nkem about Koko since their
          first meeting in 2019 but he was unavailable to make his intentions
          known. However, once in Miami, let’s just say Inyene could not wait to
          loud those intentions to whoever cared to listen. The guys arrived on
          Friday and explored Miami (South Beach) but Inyene refused to
          entertain anyone until Koko arrived. We later learned that Inyene
          confirmed his travel immediately after he learned that Helen (Koko)
          MAY be coming. Later that night in a Miami bar with the rest of the
          birthday crew, As a gentleman tht he is, Inyene asked Koko what she
          wanted to drink. And as he gave her the drink, he expressed not only
          how much he was interested in her, but also how long he’s been
          interested. She shrugged off his admiration to the drinks but his
          admiration became clear to Koko when one of Nkem’s friends told Inyene
          that she had someone for him and he boldly replied saying, “Don’t
          worry about that, the person I like is sitting right next to you.” We
          later learned that prior to this trip, Inyene mentioned to his parents
          that in addition to celebrating Nkem, there was someone (who may be on
          this trip) that he likes and was looking forward to meeting. And his
          mum responded, beckoning on him to "go have fun" and "to keep an open
          mind". Little did they know that Saturday night in Miami was the
          beginning of something unexpected and beautiful.
        </p>
        <p class="article--body">
          Sunday was Jet Ski and Beach Day, and we both had an amazing time.
          Inyene and Koko talked more and realized how much they had in common.
          They learned that his brother attended Loyola Jesuit College like she
          did, and they also learned that they had unknowingly been messaging
          each other on IG for months prior. Miami revealed that Inyene knew way
          more about Koko than she realized.
        </p>
        <p class="article--body">
          Birthday festivities ended for Koko and Inyene on Sunday night because
          they had early morning flights on Monday. They rode in the same Uber
          to the airport and talked some more. Inyene flew back to Washington
          DC, and Koko flew to Raleigh, North Carolina. They talked every day
          and each time, Inyene reminded Koko of his intentions, even though she
          still did not take him seriously. Two weeks later, Koko told Inyene
          that she did not see anything beyond friendship between them. And to
          her surprise, Inyene made it evident that he was ready to be in her
          life in any capacity that she was comfortable with, even if it was
          just friendship. Their friendship continued to grow and shortly
          afterwards, Inyene invited Koko to a weekend in DC and she obliged
          him.
        </p>
        <p class="article--body">
          Koko's birthday was on the horizon, and she decided to travel to West
          Palm Beach, FL. Without giving it much thought, she invited Inyene,
          and he was all in. Inyene and Koko bonded on the flight to West Palm.
          They talked about their families, their upbringings, tales of moving
          to the US and navigating their lives here, their shared values, their
          interests and more. They celebrated Koko's birthday together and
          returned to DC. At this time, Koko was on another travel engagement in
          Indiana/Chicago. On travel engagements, Koko could either travel home
          or travel someone to her location, so she invited Inyene and that was
          the weekend when they went on their first date. Koko teased Inyene
          that he had to take her on 5 amazing dates before she gave him an
          answer. Inyene planned their first date, and Koko was just blown away
          by his attention, his intention, and his empathy. Their first date
          went beautifully, and it was then that she knew.
        </p>
        <p class="article--body">
          They were officially dating and Inyene had already started planning
          their second date. During the July 4th holiday, as they were driving
          somewhere, Inyene received a call from his mum. He had promised to
          help marinate the meats so he asked Koko if she was comfortable with
          riding along with him to his parents so he could complete the task and
          return to his place afterwards. With an open mind, Koko obliged Inyene
          and his parents welcomed her with open arms. Koko later learned that
          this visit sealed the deal and that she had already become a permanent
          part of Inyene's life without even knowing.
        </p>
        <p class="article--body">
          Inyene planned their second date for July 15th in DC. This date was
          special to Koko for so many reasons. It is her dad’s birthday, and
          this was the second birthday that was spent without him. That morning,
          Koko went to run errands while keeping the special evening in mind,
          only to return home to the most beautiful bouquet of sunflowers. The
          card on the flowers read: “Next To You Is Exactly Where I Want To Be,
          Every Single Day, Mon Coeur! Kingsley.” Words could not describe her
          emotions that day, but it felt like God was steering the wheel.
          Throughout the date, Koko kept Inyene on edge by saying that her
          answer was dependent on the date's outcome even though she already
          knew. They walked back to the car reeling from this amazing date and
          in front of the car, Inyene asked her again and she said “Yes, I’d
          love to be your girlfriend”. It is safe to say that Koko knew her
          answer from date #1 and that she did not need 5 dates to decide or
          confirm how she felt towards Inyene.
        </p>
        <p class="article--body">
          Inyene lived in Washington DC while Koko lived 50mins west of DC which
          implied commuting to visit each other. During this time, they had
          nursed the idea of living together and Koko shared that she had always
          wanted to live in DC for a year. With Inyene’s lease reaching
          expiration, it was perfect timing to research and tour apartments in
          DC. Inyene took Koko to all the apartment tours which left them torn
          between 2 apartment options. On one of our last tours, Inyene blurted
          out that he was interested in moving to Ashburn. This impulsive idea
          turned out to be a blessing in disguise for Koko and Inyene.
        </p>
        <p class="article--body">
          Koko's mum visits the US every year from Nigeria and splits her time
          between LA and VA. When she visited Koko in September, Inyene and her
          clicked right away. Koko shared that they were planning to move in
          together and as mother's do, she asked about their intentions, advised
          Koko, and asked that she prayed about it. Inyene started moving out
          towards the end of October, and on November 1st, they began living
          together. They spent thanksgiving celebrating Inyene’s mum’s 60th
          birthday, where their relationship was further solidified by all the
          introductions to friends and family in attendance.
        </p>
        <p class="article--body">
          Koko was unable to travel to Nigeria in December 2022, so they planned
          to spend the Christmas holiday in Puerto Rico. Basking in the warmth
          and tranquility of Puerto Rico, they did not want the vacation to end.
          They welcomed 2023 with gratitude, commitment, and renewed love for
          each other. Later on New Year's Day, they drove to Inyene’s parent’s
          home to continue the celebration. Inyene later shared that his parents
          were asking when he would propose to Koko and curious of his response,
          Inyene reponded saying it will happen soon, "within the year".
        </p>
        <p class="article--body">
          Each time the proposal topic arose, Inyene said he would only share
          that it would happen before my birthday in June 2023. In January, Koko
          had begun consulting locally and the hours got intense very quickly.
          No matter how late she worked, Inyene still drove to pick her up from
          the train station, night after night. As a treat for both of us, Koko
          reserved tickets for them to experience (for the first time) a Shen
          Yun Performance at the Kennedy Center in Washington, DC. The
          performance was simply breathtaking, and was experienced with the best
          company.
        </p>
        <hr />
        <p class="article--title">The Proposal</p>
        <p class="article--body">
          Fast forward to April 2023, shy of a month from Koko's birthday,
          coupled with crazy work hours, Inyene thought they were overdue for
          another date. Koko was so excited for it that she looked up the venue,
          their menu and selected exactly want she wanted to eat. Inyene
          mentioned that they should dress up and there will be pictures. Koko
          simply wanted to enjoy the date and thge food so whatever Inyene
          suggested was totally fine. He already made all the reservations for
          April 30th. The day began and we completed chores and got ready for
          brunch. As time for brunch drew nearer, Koko told Inyene that there
          was no time to get her nails done and he said that he had called and
          shifted the time, meaning she had time to finish her nails (this
          should have been a give-away, but she was oblivious). Inyene insisted
          on helping with her press-on nails and once they finished, Inyene
          drove to the brunch location. Upon arriving, Koko asked Inyene to drop
          her in front of the restaurant so that they do not miss their
          reservation. He calmly insisted that they both walk in together. It
          was a slightly chilly day with some rain but nothing was coming
          between this brunch and Koko, so they walked in together with Koko
          walking a little bit ahead, protecting her face from the
          precipitation. As she entered the restaurant, walking past the front
          desk, her jaw dropped in excitement and pleasant surprise. Koko's eyes
          beheld each of her closest female friends and some of his as well. It
          was at that point that she realized what was happening. In amazement
          and utter disbelief, she turned around to question Inyene, only to
          find him on one knee asking Koko to be his wife. All the emotions laid
          bare and right in that moment, Koko said the easiest “YES To Forever”
          to her best friend, just 9 months after saying "YES" to becoming his
          girlfriend.
